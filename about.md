# About

Hi, I am Sanjeev. Software developer by profession. I am from India. 

We as software developers constantly keep learning new things on a day to day basis. While we are working on a subject, we might have learnt a lot but over a period of time we forget a lot too. I intend to have this blog to share my new learning and have this as a reference whenever I want to refresh my learning.

Thanks for dropping by. Do share your feedback so that I can improve on the content I share.

Sanjeev
