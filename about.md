# About

Hi, I am Sanjeev. Software developer by profession. I am from India. 

As a software developer, I constantly keep learning new things on a day to day basis. While I am working on a project, I learn a lot about the framework/ library etc... However, I  forget a lot as the time goes by or when we move over to a new project. I intend to have this blog to share my new learning as well as a reference for myself.

As I am .Net developer, do expect to have the content related to .Net

Thanks for dropping by and your time! Do share your feedback so that I can improve on the content I share.

Sanjeev
